# -Math-Word-Problem

# It is research project, In this we have to generate equation from Math word problem that is math problem given textual description.

# I took Base code from research Paper :- Learning to Reason Deductively: Math Word Problem Solving as Complex Relation Extraction

# After doing experiment and analysis. We found that The base model not able to solve such question that has extra information persent in question.

# Currently I am solving this issue, I am Introducing null operator to handle extra information and I am using sentence level embedding to improve model architecture that is able to understand the MWP.

# I found some better result than base paper, you can see the result in "Answer" Folder.

# currently I am working on model to improve accuracy .
